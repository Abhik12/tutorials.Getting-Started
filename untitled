Which proposed FIWARE enablers have you not yet managed to integrate into your solution so far?
Where are the current roadblocks issues and difficulties?


If pushed, what could you demonstrate at the moment? (not necessarily a complete solution)
What problems would you like to highlight/demonstrate within your incomplete application?
Where could we help in this regard?


How have you considered scaling within your application architecture?
